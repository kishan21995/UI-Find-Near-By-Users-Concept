# UI-Find-Near-By-Users-Concept
#Based on Android.I am building an application with a UI that gets a list of nearby users to help connect like minded people with similar interests. I know this is not a new concept, apps like Grindr do exactly what i am trying to achieve in this. How do i go about getting profile info on the application from a phone and displaying it on another phone running the same application? is there a web-server needed for this
